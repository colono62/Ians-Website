        Hello, my name is Ian and welcome to my website. I am a student in EDP University taking up the ITP2350 Web Page Design Course. I am 19 years old and have slowly but surely expanding my knowledge on Web Development. I enjoy doing things that make me feel smart and this is definitely one of those things. Hopefully i'll be able to help you in whatever way i can today! Here's a picture of my dog because why not. <img id="thor" src=SiteImage/thorman.jpg alt="my dog"></a>

        In case you were wondering, i made this website all by myself and have written all the techniques and secrets in my book. If you're interested, i have made a added a small portion of it with some very basic advice in this website. Here it is. 
        
        <p>The secret to any trade is persistence, hard work and innovation. While that may sound like generic advice, it's true. HTML by itself is not very hard to learn, it's quite simple i'd say, the real trick is CSS and how frustrating it can be. This is of course due to the unexpected outcomes, plethora of commands and the various options one has over how to customize it. 
         <a class="editlinks"  href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a> is an excellent source of information related to HTML and CSS, I learned a lot just by using their website when i have doubts over how to accomplish something.</p>

                <h2 id="IdeasHeader">Ideas for your Webpage!</h2>
            <p>In terms of ideas, there's a lot of possibilities for a website. One of the more broad applications i can see being used by the masses is a blog. It looks a lot more professional and, as a plus, you actually own your content. Another great application for the masses, a resume. How professional would it look if your personal website is a resume? Perhaps having the resume portion as another section and having it be more focused on your thoughts? There's obviously making a useful website and using Google AdSense to get some revenue for your trouble. </p>

                <h2 id="ResourcesHeader">Helpful Resources</h2>
                <p>Here are some resources for HTML and CSS, be it for learning how to code or for finding free images or music.</p>
                <ul id="ResourcesUL">
                    <li><a class="editlinks" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools.</a> As was mentioned previously, it is a great tool for learning commands, how they work and perhaps a solution to your problem. It's also a great tutorial.</li>
                    <li><a class="editlinks" href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Music">Old School Runescape</a> and <a class="editlinks" href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Music">Runescape</a> music. The music has won awards for the sheer amount of tracks there are. Old School Runescape has retro MIDI tracks and Runescape has beautiful award winning modern tracks. Both are copyright free so you can't go wrong for the purposes of making a website with these. </li>
                    <li><a class="editlinks" href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr.</a> On Flickr you can sort by copyright restrictions and find images to use on your projects. Every image on this website except my dog and the logo was retrieved from Flickr.</li>
